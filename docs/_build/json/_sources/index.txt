iAnnotateSV is a Python library and command-line software toolkit to annotate and
visualize structural variants detected from Next Generation DNA sequencing data. This works for majority is just a re-writing of a tool called dRanger_annotate written in matlab by Mike Lawrence at Broad Institue. 
But it also has some additional functionality and control over the annotation w.r.t the what transcripts to be used for annotation.
It is designed for use with hybrid capture, including both whole-exome and custom target panels, and
short-read sequencing platforms such as Illumina.
